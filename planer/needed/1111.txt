TFD is known to be successfully built on Ubuntu 32 and 64 bit machines. The makefiles are set to build in 32bit mode by default. Ubuntu 64 bit machine thus need the respective 32 bit libc and libstd++ packages (libc6-i386, g++-multilib). TFD also runs in 64 bit mode, but might reach the memory limit earlier. To run TFD, Python 2.5 or 2.6 is needed. Run TFD with the following command:

./plan domainFileName problemFileName solutionFileName
